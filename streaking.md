# Streaking

Streaking is an addictive way to keep up good habits. I use [the Streaks App](https://streaksapp.com/) on my iPhone to track my streaks.

Protips for streaking:

- Only have a limited number of things active at a time.
- Delete the habits you're not actively committed to.
- Only introduce 1-2 habits at a time, and keep a 2-6 week break before introducing new ones.
- If you're doing a long streak like [[100daysofcode]], set up rules on how you're allowed to have breaks. Otherwise, you'll end up having days, when you should be resting but instead work slowly, partly procrastinating.
