# 100 Days of Code

The [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge is great for anyone, who wants to start coding in their free time. Publicly committing to a goal and reporting the results is a great motivators.

I did the challenge in one long streak between the 13th of April and the 21st of July, 2020. This caused fatigue at times and affected how I view [[streaking]].

My highlights:

- Spent most of my time in the first half building [Morco](https://morco.app/).
- On lazy days I did CompSci/Algorithm exercises. Mostly on [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/).
- Spent most of the last half building [Auto Meeting](https://github.com/apkoponen/auto-meeting), which was supposed to be just a "quick snack" in between.
- Built and published [Tailwind Baseline](https://github.com/apkoponen/tailwind-baseline).

My log for the challenge is available on [Github](https://github.com/apkoponen/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md.)
