# Asking for Help

The most important thing you should know about asking for help is that great things happen when you do. In general, people are very kind and eager to help.

For a lot of people, asking for help is harder than it should be. Common reasons why people don't ask for help:

- Fear of exposing their "stupidity."
- Pride a.k.a. strong internal need for being "strong" and independence.
- The feeling that they're wasting busy people's precious time.
- Inability to notice when they're feeling helpless due to a defense mechanism.

Most of the time, you should ask for help if you think about whether you should. In a work context, you should ask yourself if you're asking other people to help or asking other people to do your job. People get quickly tired of people who push their work to other people by "asking for help."
