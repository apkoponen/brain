# Tuning Your Job Description

Tuning your job description refers to changing your current work description, together with your superior, to feel more engaged at work.

Some reasons for tuning your job description:

- You have outgrown your current position and start feeling bored.
- Some parts of your original job description might not fit your internal motivation and therefore require unnecessary will-power.
- You might have too much on your plate and need to lighten your workload to make room for a healthy life.

People often tune their job descriptions too rarely because they feel that they should "just do their job." They don't realize that some tasks they find unpleasant, other people enjoy. For example, I hate detail-oriented work that requires reading through tons of documents, whereas some of my co-workers love such "uninterrupted work."

Teams are one of the best places for organic responsibility tuning. When you know your co-workers well, you can share common responsibilities so that the people who enjoy them the most get to do them.
